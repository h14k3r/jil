Hey man!

I'm probably over thinking it, but just wanted to reach out and say I certtainly wasn't trying to over step my boundaries or anything like that with the crypto suggestion to the guys. 

I think I got too excited by everything and was trying to find ways to contribute. Probably should have thought it over before suggesting something I wouldn't do anymore myself. I'll be sure to keep it chill and I realize your advice is also to help everyone make responsible decsions. 
 
I'm so very grateful to have been invited to the groups  and  I will show my gratitude with my hard work and do my best to be any assest for you and the group.

Ps, Bogdan is going to kill me.
